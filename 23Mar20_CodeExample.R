# This is an example to practice using version control (Github) by creating a data set and analyzing it.

# Order of events:

# I. Create data set
# II. Produce plot of data set
# III. Commit changes 
# IV. Push to Github


# I. Create data set

x <- c(1,4,8,12)
y <- c(2,8,16,24)


# II. Produce a plot of the data set

plot(x,y)


# III. Commit changes to Github

# Press the Version Control button (green, red, and gray) from the toolbar
# Press commit
# Select the box(es) of the files you'd like to stage
# Write a comment about your edits


# IV. Pull most recent document from Github

# After you pull the most recent changes, push yours
